Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
it is a specialized branch of computer science that focuses on the systematic design, development, testing and maintenance of software applications. it entails applying engineering principles alongside programming expertise to create software systems that effectively meet user needs.
software engineering is an integral to tecnological progress with advancements in Artificial Inteligence(AI), marchine learning ML and Virtual Reality (VR), Engineers will be in the forefront of creating innovative solutions that enhance communication, productivity, and overall user experience.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-birth of software engineering (1968) coined during the NATO science committee sponsored conference in response to the 'software crisis' which was characterised by the complexity of software development and limitations of exisitng methodologies which led to significant monetary losses and project failures. the conference aimed to optimize software creations without compromising quality.
-introduction of microcomputers and workstations(1970s-1980s),it marked a significant shift in computing accessibility. with introduction of microcomputers, programming became more public allowing individuals to compile and run code without relying on mainframes. this era saw an increase in software demand.
-object-oriented programming (oop) (1980s) it introduced a new approach with 'objects' that could have specific types, different classes and independent data fields. it allowed for more modular and maintenance code

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-planning and analysis-feasibility of creating the product is evaluated. it sets the foundation for what to be developed
-define requirements-it involves converting information into a clear and actionable requirements for the development team
-design-developers create a detailed software design document that outlines system architecture, programming languages to be used, templates,platforms and security measures
-development-this phase involves coding based on the specifications outlined in previous stages
-testing- this phase is for identifying bugs or issues within software before it goes live
-deployment phase-done once the testing is complete and any necessary adjustments made. the software is deployed to a production environment where users can access it
-maintenance and support-after deployment ongoing maintenance is required to address any issues that may arise post-launch and to implement updates or enhancement bases on user feedback or changing requirements

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall and Agile methodologies are project management methodologies that cater to different types of projects and organizational needs. waterfall methodology is a linear,sequential approach to project management whereas Agile methodology takes an iterative approach that emphasizes flexibility and customer collaboration. Waterfall methodology is best suited for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal expected changes. Agile methodology prioritize continuous feedback from customers throughtout the development process

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
